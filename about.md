## Who can appear on this map?

Members with write access to the [{{ site.github_project }}](https://github.com/{{ site.github_project }}) repository can manage their visibility on this map.

## Adding your location to the map

To appear on the map, run the [Add me to the map] GitHub action.  The action can be passed:
* **Nothing**, in which case it will geocode the location you setup in your GitHub profile;
* A **location/address** which will be geocoded.  Bear in mind that you probably don't need to be more specific than the country / city you live in and providing your exact address is not advised;
* A **latitude** and a **longitude**, which allow you to point to the exact location of your choice.

## Moving your location on the map

Proceed with the [Add me to the map] GitHub action.  It will update your location, there is no need to remove your location before.

## Removing your location from the map

If you do not want to appear on the may anymore, run the [Remove me from the map] GitHub action.
